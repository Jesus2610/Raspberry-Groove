# Raspberry-Groove
Creation of a system using the raspberry, the shield of groovepi + and the groove kit

In this project we create a system that tells us when the temperature is in an optimal range of values or when the temperature has passed the maximum value that we have. With this we also created an app using app inventor that tells us the temperature that is at the moment and gives the user the posibility to change this optimal and maximum values.

## Hardware used
- Raspberry 3
- Groovepi +
- Groove kit
  - Sensors: Temperature
  - Actuators: Buzzer and LED
- Cellphone for App Inventor
## Function
The user will have his app in his cellphone where they can check the temperature at the moment they push the button, also they can change the optimal temperature and the max temperature being this system flexible for different environments that the user can adapt, by doing this if the temperature goes higher than the values the user wants the LED turns on and if the temperature values go higher than the maximum temperature the buzzer turns on until the temperature go back to normal.
